# Breaker

Breaker (BR) is both my programming language in the making and a template for your own.

## First Some Warnings...

BR is my language and IS licenced under creative commons, It can be manipulated as you please but please, give credit, and be careful with this, and if the code breaks and you cant fix it, then send me an email, it's in pyproject.toml with the share link and I will see what I can do to fix it. Non-Beta Features will be removed unless they are system related

## How does it work?

BR works off of a Lexer-Parcer system, as most languages do, using the SLY python module so that you don't have to write your own. This makes writing a language much easier, as you skip alot of steps.

## How to edit

To edit BR you quite simply edit the tokens section and the grammar section which is linked to your changes, then there SHOULD be no errors.
